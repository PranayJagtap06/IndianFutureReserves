## About the Project üíª

The **IndianFutureReserves** is a Streamlit-powered application that leverages the power of machine learning to predict India's future foreign exchange reserves. Powered by a sophisticated Prophet model, trained on authoritative data from the Reserve Bank of India, this application provides users with an intuitive and interactive platform to explore and understand the dynamics of India's financial fortunes.

If you are interested in training you own model then visit my [ML_Projects](https://github.com/PranayJagtap06/ML_Projects/) github repo and go to `Indian Economy-Foreign Exchange Reserves Prediction` folder to access the Jupyter Notebook.
